  // This took some time to get my head around but here is what I learnt:
  // Anonymous classes do not have a class name
  // Anonymous classes are used for one time, quick behaviour etc.
  // Anonymous classes do not have constructor args, unless the trait it uses does
  // Anonymous classes define new behaviour without a class name
  // HERE IS A COMPARISON between the two:
  //
  //   val newDog = new Animal {
  //     override def eat(): Unit = println("big eater")
  //   }
  //   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  //   This would be an anonymous class because I defined
  //   new behaviour and extended animal
  //
  //   And this code would be a normal class with instantiation:
  //
  //   class Dog extends Animal {
  //     override def eat(): Unit = println("big eater")

  //
  //   val newDog = new Dog()
